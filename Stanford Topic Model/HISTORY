Version 0.4.0
 - Introducing PLDA and PLDP (API only)
 - Fixes outstanding bug in LabeledLDA inference
 - Allows loading documents longer than Short.MaxValue in length
 - Specify Java max memory in GUI
 - Fix code paths so standard modification of LDA infer example to
   LabeledLDA (and PLDA) works as expected

Version 0.3.0
 - Major code refactoring and upgrade to Scala 2.8.  Improved ability to call
   from Java.
 - Incompatibilties introduced in example scripts:
   - GibbsLDA.loadInferenceModel -> GibbsLDA.loadModel
   - LDADataset constructor no longer not takes an index argument.
   - model.computePerplexity no longer takes an InferenceParams argument.
   - dataset.meta[LabelIndex] has been removed.  Use model.topicIndex instead.

Version 0.2.1
 - Automatically sort and remove duplicates in LabeledLDADataset construction.

Version 0.2 released 2009.11.20
 - Some backwards-incompatible changes were introduced in the scripting
   interface for better compatibility, performance, and coverage of the
   desired functionality.
   - import edu.stanford.nlp.tmt.stage._ should now be:
     import edu.stanford.nlp.tmt.stage.LDAStages._;
     import edu.stanford.nlp.tmt.stage.GibbsLDAStages._;
     import edu.stanford.nlp.tmt.stage.GibbsLabeledLDAStages._;
     This change enables more straightforward selection of
     capabilities desired for a script and better future-proofing
     for new capabilities.
   - InferPerWord -> GibbsLDAStages.InferPerWordTopicDistributions
 - New function GibbsLDAStages.LoadTrainingPerWordTopicDistributions:
   Load the topic distributions inferred during training on a corpus.  
 - New function LDAStages.DocumentTopicUsage:
   Output per-document distributions over topics.  Each line of the
   output can be paired with the corresponding line of the input, with
   blank lines for missing documents.
 - LDAStages.LDAQuery and LDAStages.SlicedLDAQuery now output CSV header
   lines.
 - New method LabeledLDAStages.TrainLabeledLDA trains a model using
   the GibbsLabeledLDA trainer.  The returned model is also a regular
   GibbsLDA InferenceModel.

Version 0.1.2 released 2009.10.15 
 - First public source release
 - Model training can continue from an interrupted point on disk
 - Perplexity and average per-word log probability implemented
 - Small GUI changes ("Open ..." remembers last folder, check for
   updates removed and integrated into main page)
